Timestamp all your posts, pages, users and custom post types in the Bitcoin blockchain. By Good Rebels Inc.

== Description ==

**WP Blockchain opens a whole new gateway to stamp pretty much everything into blockchain, directly from your WordPress website!**

A blockchain is a permanent and decentralized database system with no central authority. It allows to stamp content without ever unrevealing it. A stamp certifies the existence of the content at a precise moment, which helps its author to prove he/she was the first to know the content, and consequently, that he/she owns authorship rights over such content.

Protect your authorship forever, with WP Blockchain!
